# Task-5
A complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This project uncovers insights into passenger survival patterns based on gender, class, age, fare, and more—through visual storytelling and statistical exploration.
# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Titanic dataset using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## 📌 Objective

To explore and analyze the Titanic dataset, uncover patterns, relationships, and trends that influenced passenger survival.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Key EDA Tasks Performed

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values (Age, Embarked), dropping Cabin due to too many NaNs.
- Univariate Analysis:
  - Survival rate
  - Passenger class, gender, and embarked port distributions
  - Fare and Age distributions
- Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:
  - Survival by gender, class, age, and fare
  - Pairplot of major numerical variables
  - Correlation matrix using heatmap

## Summary of Findings & Insights
- Survival Rate: ~38% passengers survived.
- Females had higher survival rate than males.
- Higher-class passengers (Pclass 1) had better survival.
- Younger passengers had slightly higher survival.
- Fares varied a lot, and higher fare was linked to survival.
- Cabin had too many missing values, dropped.

## 📈 Key Insights

- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- First-class passengers had better survival outcomes.
- Age and fare had mild correlations with survival probability.
- Passengers who embarked from Southampton formed the majority.

---

## 💡 Outcome

- Developed skills in identifying trends, relationships, and anomalies in real-world data.
- Built strong foundational knowledge in data visualization and statistical analysis using Python.
